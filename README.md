# Accident Prevention System

With the help of our project we aim to quantify the persistent problem of accidents caused by Headlight dazzles or Troxler effect. Therefore, the objective of our project is to infuse with the pre-existing feature of “NCAR: Nighttime Collision Avoidance System”, an additional feature of an automatic headlight dipper.
